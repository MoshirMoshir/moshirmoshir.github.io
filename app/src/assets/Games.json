Made in collaboration with my friend; he did all the sound and music while I did all the art and coding. Terragrow turned out much better than I could have ever hoped, especially for a first playable game. Though the mechanics are a bit fincky, I'm satisfied at the custom art and music we were able to make in such a short time as well as the implemntation of logic through Unity and C#!",
